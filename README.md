# Curriculum Vitae Application

A very simple CV Application built using Webpack, React, and CSS. 

This project was originally built using entirely class components, and was later updated using entirely functional components and hooks.
You can still view the original class component code as a comment at the bottom of each respective file.

This was my first React project, and as such, many skills were honed during the process. Here's a highlight of some of the skills learned:

* Building Class components in React
* Building functional components in React
* Using hooks to gain access to state in functional components
* Elevating state for use across multiple child components
* Working with the React synthetic event to dynamically get user inputs
