This project was originally built using entirely class components, and was later updated using entirely functional components and hooks.
You can still view the original class component code as a comment at the bottom of each respective file.

This was my first React project, and as such, many skills were honed during the process. Here's a highlight of some of the skills learned:

* Building Class components in React
* Building functional components in React
* Using hooks to gain access to state in functional components
* Elevating state for use across multiple child components
* Working with the React synthetic event to dynamically get user inputs
